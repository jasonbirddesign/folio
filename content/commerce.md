::work-hero{company="OpenTable" title="Leading a new line of business at OpenTable" image="https://placehold.co/450x200" intro="A year ago I was presented with the opportunity to take more of a design leadership role at OpenTable. The business needed to find a way to grow a new revenue stream and thus the Commerce line of Business was born. We had a mission to drive more transactional revenue through the platform and also serve as more of an R&D hub to prove out new business offerings that could position OpenTable more favourably over our competitors." :role='["Lead Product Designer/", "Design Manager"]' :team='["Group Product Manager", "Director of Engineering", "Product Marketing Manager"]'}

## Translating strategy to design direction

With an OKR to increase transactional volume and hit a $6M target. As a leadership team and seeking council from executive partners we workshopped where we could best position our efforts to reach this goal. We identified our opportunity areas we had the highest confidence in and mapped them to hypothesised value propositions and  forecasted opportunity size. After following feedback and counsel from the execustive team we landed on pursuing a Private Dining offering.

This was the start of translating the business goal of $6M to actionable direction for the design team to relate to and begin to ask questions that would later evolve into full research plan as part of the discovery phase in response to the direction.

## Managing the workflow and processes of the design team across time zones

Outside of the core commerce teams there were many cross functional partners in both design and product where there would be notable overlap and/or opportunities for collaboration. Clarifying these fuzzy edges was important so we were not duplicating work efforts or losing track of task accountabilities. 

Additionally for a remote focused team I also scheduled a regular cadence of meetings and ‘go-to’ slack channels so we can routinely meet & discuss anything from informal progress updates, unblocking any of the teams needs as well a meeting with design leadership from parallel teams.

Setting these precedents from the start led to fostering a culture of sharing little and often as opposed to big reveals between wider spaces of time which complemented our existing design critique sessions and ultimately embraced & improved on a culture of trust and feedback.

## Advocating for the team & navigating senior stakeholder feedback

After some thorough user research, the team had built a great picture of what we needed to build to drive value for a prospective Private Dining user. The team created user flows & wireframes and started to socialise the design direction. At this stage of process it opened up alot of pushback on whether we were building the right thing. I took this opportunity to advocate for the team building on all the great research we had and drive alignment with our senior stakeholders with a reframing session.

The focus was to highlight what new learnings we had and reassess has this changed how we felt about the solution we were designing for. We came out of this session much clearer as a team and a smaller scope for beta release. This was strategic decision to build up from our iterative learnings before integrating too much of our core product suites functionality.

## Managing up and managing down

As the team continued to make great progress I was focused on tracking the design activities they were conducting to make sure we were meeting out commitments as a line of business and also staying ahead of the curve if we needed to pivot. Remaining agile so wan adjust our design process is essential for the process it keeps the team nimble being   able to react and experiment as we gather more research and data.

This part of my process served as a double edge sword as it allowed me to confidently manage up to OpenTables CEO & SVP in how these activities made up key project milestones that drove us closer to delivery with a focus on decerning between what we want to build vs what we can build with the available engineering resource.
